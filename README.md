# Handwritten-Digit-Classification-using-MNIST
This repository introduces to my project "Handwritten-Digit-Classification" using MNIST Data-set . This project was implemented and executed by applying KNN algorithm with recognition accuracy of around 91-93 % . The desired results have been obtained by training the machine first using the mnist_train data-set and later testing the obtained results using mnist_test data-set , to recognise the handwritten digits.
